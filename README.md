# QR Code Generator
<p>I'm thrilled to present my most recent project, a QR Code Generator that helps create QR code according to user specifications. I utilised the Cross-browser QRCode generator JavaScript library for making this project.</p>
<br>
<p>It has various features:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The QR Code is generated for the particular text or the URL which the user enters. In case nothing is given as input, no QR Code is generated and an alert pops up specifying the user to enter something.</li>
<li>The size of the generated QR can be changed (some pre-defined dimensions are available). Again, if no input is given, no size change will occur and an alert appears that details to provide a suitable text/URL.</li>
<li>After providing inputs, there is a 'Generate Button' which will generate the QR Code based on the input of the selected size.</li>
<li>After the QR is generated, there is a 'Download Button' for downloading the generated QR Code as a .jpeg file.</li>
<li><b>You can scan the QR Code with your mobile phones and it will pertain to the text or the URL which was given as the initial input.</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to fork this project and add whatever you like. If you have any suggestions or any comments please feel free to contact me or open an issue.</p>
